        WarmDM rewrites your messages based on the tone you choose.
        The output is generated automatically and may not always reflect what you intended.
      </p>

      <h3>Use your judgment</h3>
      <p>
        You are responsible for reviewing and deciding whether a rewritten message
        is appropriate before sending it. You should treat the output as a suggestion,
        not a command.
      </p>

      <h3>Not professional advice</h3>
      <p>
        WarmDM does not provide legal, medical, business, or relationship advice.
        All outputs are for casual, informational, or creative use.
      </p>

      <h3>Accuracy</h3>
      <p>
        Like all AI tools, responses may sometimes be incorrect, incomplete,
        or unpredictable. If something looks wrong, don’t use it.
