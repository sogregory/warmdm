      <p>
        By using WarmDM, you agree to these simple terms. We keep them short, clear,
        and human — just like our rewrites.
      </p>

      <h3>1. This is a rewriting tool</h3>
      <p>
        WarmDM helps you rephrase messages. You are responsible for what you send,
        post, or share after using the tool.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Don’t misuse the service</h3>
      <p>
        Please don’t use WarmDM for harassment, threats, scams, harmful content,
        or anything illegal. WarmDM is here to make communication nicer, not worse.
      </p>

      <h3>3. No guarantees</h3>
      <p>
        The tool is provided “as is.” We do our best to keep everything running,
        fast, and accurate — but we can’t promise uninterrupted uptime or
        perfect outputs.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        We use lightweight analytics to understand what’s being used, what’s not,
        and how to improve the product. Nothing creepy.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Changes</h3>
      <p>
        We may update these terms as WarmDM evolves. If something important changes,
        we’ll update this page.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Contact</h3>
